        <h1>big bang theories</h1>
        <p id="smallParag">The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, including
            astronomy, physics, philosophy and metaphysics. The following is an overview
            of different theories related to the cosmos:

                    This is the most recent theory explaining the origin and evolution of the universe.
                    The Big Bang theory suggests that the history of the universe began
                    with the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. As a result
                    of the Big Bang, time, space,
                    and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

                            String theory is one approcahc that seeks a unified description of the physical world.
                            According to this theory, we live in a three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos 
                            might contain additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments) that are part of confined spaces with different 
                            sizes a d charasteristics.
